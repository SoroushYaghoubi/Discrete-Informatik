# Discrete-Informatik
Here I will implement descrete mathematic concepts that are related to computer science. 


## Expl.

The point of this project is to implement interesting mathematical objects and algorithms 
that would be considered as a part of descrete mathematics. I will try to keep things as
close as possible to the actual mathematical objects. For example if the definition of an
object is a set, I will use a set. 

Because of the importance of the object types in this project, I will use Java to keep things
safer.
